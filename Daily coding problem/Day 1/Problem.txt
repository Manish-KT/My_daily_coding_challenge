The problem at hand is to merge K sorted lists, each with N elements, into a single sorted list. In simpler terms, you are given K lists, and you need to combine them into one list while maintaining a sorted order.

Input:

K sorted lists, where each list contains N elements.
Output:

A new list that includes all elements from the input lists, sorted in ascending
order.
Example Input:
[[10, 15, 30], [12, 15, 20], [17, 20, 32]]

Example Output:
[10, 12, 15, 15, 17, 20, 20, 30, 32]

The tutorial outlines a systematic approach for solving this problem,
starting with understanding an example, discussing possible brute force
solutions, proposing a more efficient solution using a heap data structure,
providing pseudocode for the efficient solution, writing the actual code,
suggesting various test cases, and encouraging consideration of alternative
solutions.
