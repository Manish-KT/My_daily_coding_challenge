Problem Statement:

You are given an implementation of the cons function, which takes two arguments
a and b and returns a pair. Additionally, you are provided with the car and cdr
 functions, but they are incomplete. Your task is to implement the car and cdr
 functions to extract the first and last elements of the pair, respectively.

Function Definitions:

def cons(a, b): Constructs a pair of elements a and b and returns a function
pair that can be used to retrieve these elements.

def car(pair): Returns the first element of the pair.

def cdr(pair): Returns the second element of the pair.

Examples:

For the pair constructed with cons(3, 4), car(cons(3, 4)) should return 3,
and cdr(cons(3, 4)) should return 4.

Note:
You need to implement the car and cdr functions such that they work with the
cons function provided. The pair is constructed using cons, and you should use
 the provided functions to extract its elements.
