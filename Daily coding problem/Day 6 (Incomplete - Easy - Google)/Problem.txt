Problem Statement:

You are given the root of a binary tree. A unival tree, which stands for "universal value" tree,
is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value. Your task is to count the number of unival
subtrees in the given binary tree.

Input:

The root of a binary tree.
Output:

An integer representing the count of unival subtrees in the binary tree.
Example:

Input:
    0
   / \
  1   0
     / \
    1   0
   / \
  1   1

Output: 5
In the example, the binary tree has 5 unival subtrees, each of which contains nodes with the same value:

The root node with value 0.
The left subtree with a single node having value 1.
The right subtree with a single node having value 0.
The subtree rooted at the second left node with a single node having value 1.
The subtree rooted at the bottom left node with a single node having value 1.

Note:
The input binary tree is not necessarily a binary search tree (BST).
The value of nodes in the tree can be of any data type (e.g., integers, characters, or custom objects).
